# Markdown Notes App

I've been looking for a new notes app. During my research, I came up with a set of criteria for what I wanted my new notes app to include:

1. Simple
2. Cheap
3. Cross-compatible
4. Markdown

I had a difficult time finding an app that fit all of these requirements. Either they were overly complicated, or too expensive, or were not cross-compatible. 

So I decided to do it myself.
